Welcome! This is where I share my thoughts, projects, and experiences.

## Running the Project

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: First, you need to install the necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the Development Server**: Run the local development server to see your changes in real-time.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Build the Project**: When you're ready to deploy, build the project for production.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4. **Preview the Build**: You can preview the production build locally before deploying.
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

5. **Run Astro Commands**: Use the Astro CLI for additional commands.
    ```bash
    npm run astro ...
    ```
