Hi , I am writting short steps about how to install latest gdal version in your debian stable. 

By the time I am writting this post the default version of gdal available in the stable debian bookworm is 3.6.5 but I want the latest one . Usually gdal will publish the latest release in the unstable source first. if you wanna get your hand on it either you need to install it from the source or you can install it from the unstable source. I will list how to install from unstable source only for the gdal

1) First update sour package list 

```bash
 sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Add following line 
```bash
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free
```

2) Update package list 

```bash
sudo apt update
```

3) Now install gdal-bin using unstable source

```bash
sudo apt install -t unstable gdal-bin
```
4) Check your gdal version 

```bash
ogrinfo --version
```
