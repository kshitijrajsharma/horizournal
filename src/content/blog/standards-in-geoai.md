# Introduction

Geospatial AI has rapidly grown, with applications ranging from
land-cover mapping to disaster damage assessment. However, a historical
lack of standards for organizing training data and models has led to
fragmented practices ([Yue 2023](#ref-copernicus2023)). In recent years,
multiple initiatives have emerged to improve the FAIR (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles in GeoAI by
standardizing how datasets and models are described and shared. This
review examines key efforts, including the STAC-MLM extension for model
metadata, the OGC TrainingDML-AI standard for training data, open-source
frameworks like Raster Vision and TerraTorch, and commercial approaches
such as Esri’s GeoAI toolbox. We compare their scope, design, and
adoption, and discuss trends and humanitarian use cases.

# STAC-MLM: SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog – Machine Learning Model Extension

[STAC-MLM](https://github.com/stac-extensions/mlm) is a community-driven
extension to the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification,
designed to catalog and describe machine learning models that use
geospatial data ([Wherobots 2023](#ref-wherobots2023)). Developed by
organizations such as CRIM, Wherobots, Terradue, Radiant Earth, and
NRCan, and presented at the 2024 ACM SIGSPATIAL conference
([Charette-Migneault, Bédard, and Vincent 2024](#ref-charette2024)),
STAC-MLM aims to make models discoverable alongside datasets and to
capture all metadata needed for reuse or deployment. However, this is
not the first one that tries to use STAC for machine learning it is more
of successor of the extension which was started at Radiant Earth on
October 4th, 2021. It was possibly the first STAC extension dedicated to
describing machine learning models as per this
[PR](https://github.com/stac-extensions/ml-model/pull/19/files)

alt="Overview of STAC-MLM" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Overview of STAC-MLM</figcaption>
</figure>

Key features of STAC-MLM include:

- **Geospatial context**: Spatial and temporal domain of the model,
  clarifying where and when it is applicable.
- **Input data specifications**: Required sensor bands or input types
  and any preprocessing steps (e.g., rescaling, normalization) needed
  ([Wherobots 2023](#ref-wherobots2023)).
- **Output description**: The model’s output shape, type, and semantic
  meaning (e.g., class labels for segmentation).
- **Runtime requirements**: An optional description of required runtime
  environments, frameworks, or hardware to ensure reproducibility.
- **Provenance and references**: Links to training details, scientific
  papers, or dataset sources.

STAC-MLM reuses STAC fields where possible and enables models to be
represented as STAC Items or Collections, making them searchable via
standard STAC APIs. By structuring model metadata consistently, it
ensures that models become first-class, discoverable assets ([Wherobots
2023](#ref-wherobots2023)).

The motivation behind STAC-MLM arose from inconsistent documentation
practices, where data scientists repurposed general-purpose model cards
without standardizing geospatial-specific metadata ([Wherobots
2023](#ref-wherobots2023)). By introducing a common schema, STAC-MLM
enables model portability and consistency, allowing a model published by
one group to be understood and reused by others more easily.

**Adoption**: Despite being relatively new, STAC-MLM has seen early
adoption. Wherobots’ “Raster Inference” platform uses STAC-MLM for model
imports, allowing users to bring their models with a JSON descriptor.
Radiant Earth’s MLHub and Terradue workflows have also integrated
STAC-MLM, further demonstrating its practical utility ([Wherobots
2023](#ref-wherobots2023); [Radiant Earth Foundation
2021](#ref-radiant2021)). I particularly like this form builder for
validating STAC for ML : [ML Model stac
validator](https://mlm-form.vercel.app/) You can find schema reference
[here](https://stac-extensions.github.io/mlm/v1.4.0/schema.json) .

# OGC TrainingDML-AI: Standardizing Geospatial Training Data

While STAC-MLM focuses on model metadata, the [OGC
TrainingDML-AI](https://docs.ogc.org/is/23-008r3/23-008r3.html) standard
addresses the organization of training datasets. Released by the Open
Geospatial Consortium in 2023–2024, TrainingDML-AI defines a conceptual
model and encoding methods (JSON, XML) for documenting geospatial ML
training datasets ([Open Geospatial Consortium 2023](#ref-ogc2023)).

Key conceptual entities in TrainingDML-AI include:

- **AI_TrainingDataset**: The collection of training samples (e.g., a
  dataset for land cover classification).
- **AI_TrainingData**: A single training sample, such as an image and
  its corresponding labels.
- **AI_Task**: The ML task type (e.g., classification, detection,
  segmentation).
- **AI_Label**: Semantic description of labels, supporting scene-level,
  object-level, and pixel-level labels.
- **AI_Labeling**: Documentation of labeling procedures, provenance, and
  responsible entities, aligned with W3C PROV.
- **DataQuality**: Metadata describing dataset quality and
  uncertainties, following ISO 19157 standards.
- **AI_TDChangeset**: Versioning metadata to track updates or
  corrections between dataset releases.

alt="TrainingDML-AI module overview" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">TrainingDML-AI module
overview</figcaption>
</figure>

TrainingDML-AI cleanly separates general metadata from domain-specific
extensions, such as Earth Observation fields, supporting a wide range of
AI domains while maintaining flexibility ([Yue
2023](#ref-copernicus2023)).

The standard also defines JSON encoding formats to allow
machine-readable and web-compatible descriptions, making it easier to
publish, discover, and validate geospatial training datasets.

**Comparison to STAC Label Extension**: Before TrainingDML-AI, Radiant
MLHub primarily used the STAC Label Extension to package training
datasets. While effective, the STAC Label Extension focused primarily on
imagery and label connections, lacking structured provenance, data
quality, and versioning metadata. TrainingDML-AI expands this scope,
offering a richer, more extensible model for dataset description ([Yue
2023](#ref-copernicus2023)).

# Radiant MLHub (Currently Source Cooperative) and Prior Community Efforts

Prior to the establishment of STAC-MLM and TrainingDML-AI, the
geospatial community had already recognized the need for standardization
around training datasets. Radiant Earth Foundation launched Radiant
MLHub in 2019 as an open registry for geospatial ML datasets ([Radiant
Earth Foundation 2019](#ref-radiant2019)). Radiant MLHub uses a
STAC-compliant catalog and the STAC Label Extension to store imagery and
corresponding labels in a consistent, machine-readable format. However I
couldn’t find the working link of radiant MLHUB at the moment. Only this
[Blog](https://medium.com/radiant-earth-insights/accessing-and-downloading-training-data-on-the-radiant-mlhub-api-f04dc635592f)
, As per this
[Article](https://radiant.earth/blog/2023/05/radiant-earth-announces-new-initiatives-to-accelerate-sharing-of-earth-science-data/)
As of October 2023, all content previously available on Radiant MLHub
has been migrated to [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/), and
access to Radiant MLHub has been discontinued. Source Cooperative
continues to be developed and supported by Radiant Earth, with the goal
of making Earth science data more accessible and easier to use.

Each dataset on MLHub is organized as a STAC Collection of imagery Items
and Label Items, with standardized metadata describing label classes,
geospatial information, and dataset splits (train/validation). This
early effort pioneered the FAIR publication of training datasets,
allowing users to programmatically search and access resources through
standard APIs ([Radiant Earth Foundation 2021](#ref-radiant2021)).

In addition to datasets, Radiant Earth expanded MLHub to include
pretrained geospatial models by late 2021. These models were cataloged
using an early version of the STAC ML Model Extension , effectively a
precursor to STAC-MLM , linking models to their corresponding training
datasets ([Radiant Earth Foundation 2021](#ref-radiant2021)). For
example, Radiant Earth cataloged a tropical storm wind-speed estimation
model alongside its training data, creating a clear lineage between data
and models. This approach made it possible for researchers to query
models based on task, region, or input data type, significantly
improving model discoverability.

Other early community initiatives also contributed to standardization
efforts. The OGC Testbed-18 project in 2022 examined metadata best
practices for training datasets and recommended paths toward
standardization ([Open Geospatial Consortium 2023](#ref-ogc2023)).
Meanwhile, prototypes like the Deep Learning Metadata (DLM) proposal and
an early ML Model STAC extension by groups such as Azavea and USGS laid
important groundwork, although they lacked broad adoption. The design of
the current STAC-MLM unified these earlier ideas into a more
comprehensive and sustainable community standard.

In summary, early efforts like Radiant MLHub demonstrated that existing
geospatial data standards (e.g., STAC) could be adapted to handle
machine learning needs. These experiences informed the development of
newer, formal standards like TrainingDML-AI and STAC-MLM, ensuring
compatibility with the broader geospatial community’s tools and
practices.

# Raster Vision: Open-Source GeoAI Pipeline

While standards like STAC-MLM and TrainingDML-AI address data and model
documentation, open-source frameworks such as [Raster
Vision](https://rastervision.io/) focus on operationalizing end-to-end
machine learning pipelines for geospatial data. Initially developed by
Azavea and now community-maintained, Raster Vision provides a
configurable system for training and deploying models on overhead
imagery ([Azavea 2020](#ref-rastervision2020)).

<figure>
<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1LJMzcJle.png"
alt="Raster Vision Pipeline" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Raster Vision Pipeline</figcaption>
</figure>

Raster Vision supports common geospatial ML tasks, including:

- **Chip Classification**: Classifying small image patches (useful for
  land-cover classification).
- **Object Detection**: Detecting and localizing objects using bounding
  boxes.
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Per-pixel classification to delineate
  features like buildings, roads, and vegetation.

The framework handles geospatial-specific challenges such as very large
image sizes, multiple spectral bands, and diverse coordinate systems.
Raster Vision can ingest standard GIS data formats (e.g., GeoJSON,
shapefiles) and satellite imagery (e.g., GeoTIFFs). It is flexible with
input data formats, supporting labeling schemas like COCO JSON and
Pascal VOC XML.

While Raster Vision does not impose a new data standard, it aligns well
with community practices. For example, it can ingest imagery and labels
organized using STAC catalogs. The developers have also expressed
interest in deeper STAC integration, where data discovery could happen
dynamically through STAC APIs ([Azavea 2020](#ref-rastervision2020)).

Models trained with Raster Vision are bundled with configuration files
and sample outputs, creating a semi-standardized model package. Although
**Raster Vision does not yet natively export STAC-MLM metadata**, users
could manually create an MLM JSON descriptor based on the training
configuration, facilitating broader sharing and reuse.

In practice, Raster Vision has been widely adopted in the humanitarian
and development sectors for tasks such as crop mapping in Africa and
post-disaster building detection. Its emphasis on reproducible pipelines
and flexible data handling makes it a key component in the emerging
GeoAI ecosystem.

# TerraTorch and Geospatial Foundation Models

The rise of geospatial foundation models ; very large models pre-trained
on broad Earth observation data has brought new tools and challenges to
the GeoAI field. [TerraTorch](https://ibm.github.io/terratorch/stable/),
developed by IBM Research and collaborators in 2023–2024, is an
open-source toolkit designed to fine-tune and benchmark these foundation
models ([Kumar, Suresh, and Srivastava 2024](#ref-terratorch2024)).

Built on PyTorch Lightning, TerraTorch provides modular components
specialized for satellite, weather, and climate data. It offers
domain-specific data modules for handling multi-band imagery and
time-series datasets, along with preconfigured tasks for classification,
regression, and segmentation.

Key features of TerraTorch include:

- A **model factory** enabling users to swap pre-trained backbone
  encoders and task-specific decoder heads without coding.
- **No-code fine-tuning** workflows using YAML/JSON configurations.
- **Automated hyperparameter tuning** through an “Iterate” extension to
  optimize training runs.
- **Integration with GEO-Bench**, a benchmark suite offering
  standardized geospatial evaluation tasks for foundation models.

<figure>
<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1AxbGcJxx.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="TerraTorch Pipeline" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">TerraTorch Pipeline</figcaption>
</figure>

TerraTorch enables users to quickly adapt large pre-trained models, such
as Prithvi-EO or Clay, to specific applications like flood mapping or
crop classification. Although it does not define a new metadata
standard, TerraTorch consumes data via standard geospatial loaders like
TorchGeo, which can read STAC catalogs and related formats.

By integrating standardized evaluation suites like GEO-Bench, TerraTorch
supports reproducible benchmarking of foundation models. As foundation
models become more common in Earth observation, frameworks like
TerraTorch will likely play a central role in operationalizing them for
humanitarian and climate applications.

# Commercial GeoAI Platforms: Esri’s Approach

Commercial GIS platforms have also embraced GeoAI integration, albeit
with different approaches to standardization. Esri’s ArcGIS Pro includes
a [GeoAI
toolbox](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/geoai/an-overview-of-the-geoai-toolbox.htm)
that provides tools for training and applying AI models on geospatial
data ([Esri 2024](#ref-esri2024)).

The GeoAI toolbox supports:

- Training regression and classification models on spatial tabular data.
- Object detection and pixel classification on imagery.
- Natural language processing tools for text geolocation and time-series
  forecasting.

Rather than creating new data standards, Esri ensures compatibility with
widely used machine learning formats such as COCO, Pascal VOC, and
KITTI. These formats allow data interoperability between ArcGIS and
popular open-source frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

For model metadata, Esri defines the Esri Model Definition (.emd)
format, a JSON structure describing input channels, class names, model
architecture, and inference parameters. EMD files are bundled with model
weights into Deep Learning Packages (.dlpk) for deployment within
ArcGIS.

While EMD serves a similar purpose to STAC-MLM—capturing model
metadata—it is Esri-specific and oriented toward its ecosystem. STAC-MLM
remains platform-agnostic, intended for broader discovery and reuse
across systems.

Esri’s GeoAI tools emphasize user-friendliness, allowing non-programmers
to train and deploy models within familiar GIS workflows. However, they
also create some siloing: models and metadata created in ArcGIS may
require conversion before being used in fully open ecosystems.

# Comparison of Approaches

Different initiatives in GeoAI standardization target different parts of
the machine learning lifecycle:

- **Scope**: STAC-MLM standardizes model metadata, while OGC
  TrainingDML-AI standardizes training data metadata. Raster Vision and
  TerraTorch focus on operationalizing workflows. Esri GeoAI offers
  end-to-end tools within its proprietary platform.
- **Type**: STAC-MLM and TrainingDML-AI are formal standards. Radiant
  MLHub and GEO-Bench implement standards. Raster Vision and TerraTorch
  are open-source frameworks. Esri GeoAI is a proprietary
  implementation.
- **Community involvement**: STAC-MLM and TrainingDML-AI were developed
  through open collaboration involving multiple stakeholders. Raster
  Vision and TerraTorch are maintained by open communities or
  open-source foundations. Esri’s efforts are developed internally with
  user input but are closed source.
- **Interoperability**: STAC-MLM and TrainingDML-AI are designed for
  interoperability across platforms and organizations. Raster Vision and
  TerraTorch increasingly support standardized formats like STAC. Esri
  focuses on in-ecosystem workflows but allows for import/export in
  common formats.
- **Metadata richness**: TrainingDML-AI includes detailed provenance and
  data quality metadata. STAC-MLM captures model input requirements,
  output semantics, and runtime environments. Earlier practices often
  lacked this level of documentation.
- **FAIR principles**: All reviewed initiatives emphasize improving
  Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability,
  although with varying degrees of emphasis and maturity.

Overall, STAC-MLM and TrainingDML-AI complement each other, providing
metadata coverage across the data-model pipeline. Raster Vision and
TerraTorch operationalize GeoAI tasks, while Esri focuses on
accessibility within a commercial GIS environment.

# Trends in GeoAI Standardization

A major trend in the GeoAI landscape is the convergence on STAC as a
backbone for organizing both geospatial datasets and machine learning
models. Many initiatives, including Radiant MLHub, STAC-MLM, Raster
Vision (roadmap), and AWS data catalogs, are either building on or
planning support for STAC-based structures ([Charette-Migneault, Bédard,
and Vincent 2024](#ref-charette2024); [Radiant Earth Foundation
2021](#ref-radiant2021)). This convergence enables more seamless
discovery: an analyst could potentially query a single STAC API to find
both input data and pretrained models for a given task.

Another trend is the formalization of community practices into industry
standards. The involvement of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) in
formalizing TrainingDML-AI demonstrates that FAIR dataset practices are
maturing into internationally recognized protocols. As TrainingDML-AI
becomes more widely adopted, tools and repositories are likely to
incorporate automated validation, metadata conversion, and training
workflows based on these standards ([Open Geospatial Consortium
2023](#ref-ogc2023)).

Open-source tools are also evolving to integrate these standards. PySTAC
libraries now support STAC-MLM, and emerging tools like pyTDML are aimed
at supporting TrainingDML-AI datasets. Raster Vision and TerraTorch are
aligning with open data access via STAC APIs and TorchGeo modules,
respectively.

Finally, the rise of geospatial foundation models, such as IBM-NASA’s
Prithvi-EO and other self-supervised Earth observation models, is
driving a need for standardized benchmarking and metadata. GEO-Bench
provides a common evaluation suite, while TerraTorch operationalizes
benchmarking workflows. This signals a broader maturing of GeoAI, moving
from isolated experiments toward a reproducible, scalable discipline.

As GeoAI models move from research to production, **deployment and
containerization** strategies have become critical for standardization.
One prominent trend is using orchestration frameworks
([Flyte](https://flyte.org/), [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/),
[ZenML](https://www.zenml.io/), etc.) on Kubernetes clusters to run
geospatial ML pipelines in a repeatable way. I need to do further
research on this and perhaps include those topics in next blog.

# Applications in Humanitarian GeoAI

Standardization efforts like STAC-MLM and TrainingDML-AI have
significant implications for humanitarian applications of geospatial AI.

First, **data sharing for disaster response** becomes more effective.
When multiple agencies contribute labeled datasets after an event,
consistent metadata enables others to quickly find, validate, and reuse
those datasets. TrainingDML-AI’s support for provenance and quality
metrics builds trust in shared resources, critical for decisions made
under crisis conditions ([Yue 2023](#ref-copernicus2023)).

Second, **pretrained models for humanitarian tasks** become more
portable. Models for flood detection, crop failure prediction, or
building damage assessment can be described using STAC-MLM metadata,
making it easier for responders to identify and deploy relevant models
without building new ones from scratch ([Wherobots
2023](#ref-wherobots2023)).

Third, **collaboration and capacity building** benefit greatly from
common standards. Volunteers, NGOs, and governments can work more easily
together when datasets and models are described in interoperable ways.
Standards lower technical barriers for cross-organizational efforts,
increasing the reach of humanitarian AI initiatives. Which can be also
seen in AI initiative called [fAIr](fAIr) developed by Humanitarian
OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM)

Fourth, **transparency and ethics** are improved. Standardized model and
dataset descriptions enable users to assess the applicability and
limitations of AI systems, a critical concern in humanitarian contexts
where the consequences of model errors can be severe.

Finally, early examples such as Radiant Earth’s MLHub datasets and
SpaceNet challenges show that open, standardized datasets accelerate
innovation and improve humanitarian outcomes by enabling broader reuse
and benchmarking ([Radiant Earth Foundation 2019](#ref-radiant2019)).

# Conclusion

The GeoAI field is undergoing a vital transformation through the
adoption of standards such as STAC-MLM and OGC TrainingDML-AI. These
initiatives address longstanding gaps in how geospatial datasets and
machine learning models are documented, discovered, and reused.
Open-source frameworks like Raster Vision and TerraTorch, and even
commercial platforms like Esri’s GeoAI toolbox, are increasingly
integrating standard practices, signaling a broader convergence across
sectors. Initiative like fAIr by HOTOSM which is trying to reduce the
complexity for wider community to use AI in disasters

Yet challenges remain. Although these standards provide robust
frameworks, real-world adoption is still limited, especially in
humanitarian contexts where ease of use is crucial. While developing
models and datasets can remain a technical task, deploying and
operationalizing them during emergencies must become significantly
easier. The lack of intuitive, user-friendly systems that leverage these
standards points to an urgent need for further research and tool
development.

As humanitarian challenges grow more complex and urgent, standardized,
discoverable, and easily deployable GeoAI models and datasets will
become foundational to effective response efforts. Continued
collaboration between open communities, standards bodies, researchers,
and commercial providers will be essential to realizing the full
potential of a FAIR, interoperable, and impactful GeoAI ecosystem.
