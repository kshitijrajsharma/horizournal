The goal of this tutorial is to share my experience and steps I followed when I tried to work with Sentinel-1 Radar Data to findout the displacement caused by the earthquake in Nepal. 

## Study Area 

*JajarKot Nepal* : https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/4586357#map=10/28.9246/82.3151

There was a deadly earath quake in Early November 2023 which killed more than 157 people as per CNN . I wanted to figure out how much displacement it has cased in the area , Did topography went up ? or went down. As we know due to tectonic plates movement it will always result in displacement !
