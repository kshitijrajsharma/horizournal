The goal of this tutorial is to share my experience and steps I followed when I tried to work with Sentinel-1 Radar Data to findout the displacement caused by the earthquake in Nepal. 

## Study Area 

*JajarKot Nepal* : https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/4586357#map=10/28.9246/82.3151

There was a deadly earath quake in Early November 2023 which killed more than 157 people as per CNN . I wanted to figure out how much displacement it has cased in the area , Did topography went up ? or went down. As we know due to tectonic plates movement it will always result in displacement ! 

## Preparation 

Lets first verify that even exists , get the event details from USGS . USGS mainatains the eartquake catalog which will give the event date, magnitude and approx coordinate for the event .

Prepare your filter accordingly to  your event , For us as CNN reported the incident in november 3 , I am keeping filter from Novemeber 2 to 4  in Jajarkot Area . This is how my search filter result looks like : https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?currentFeatureId=us7000l8p5&extent=22.2586%2C75.81665&extent=31.72817%2C91.70288&range=search&sort=largest&search=%7B%22name%22%3A%22Search+Results%22%2C%22params%22%3A%7B%22starttime%22%3A%222022-01-01+00%3A00%3A00%22%2C%22endtime%22%3A%222024-12-08+23%3A59%3A59%22%2C%22maxlatitude%22%3A32.319%2C%22minlatitude%22%3A24.121%2C%22maxlongitude%22%3A89.868%2C%22minlongitude%22%3A78.354%2C%22minmagnitude%22%3A5%2C%22orderby%22%3A%22magnitude%22%7D%7D

We found event details , it's coordinate and confirmation from USGS , Now we can move forward to downloading the Sentinel Image 


## Download Image 

I am using the ASF Data Search by NASA :  https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/

Click on filters Nearby search 

Here are the parameters for my Search filters : 

Area of Interest : POINT(82.153 28.858) (You can convert your coords to WKT with https://wktmap.com/ )
Start Date : 2023/10/01
End Date : 2023/11/30 (To be on safe side I am trying to find image within two months frame to filter out the best image before and after the event )
File Type : L1 Single Look Complex (SLC) (......why ? .....)
Beam Mode : IW ( Because IW covers Orbit and EW covers Polar region )

Polarizations : VV ( VV polarization can provide good representation of the terrain , and here we are interested in the terrain displacement hence VV , I had to remove VV from filter as it was not showing any image hence I will select it in later during preprocessing of image ) 
Direction : Ascending  (...why ?...)

I am selecting two image based on my region of interest : 
After the event :: Novemeber 10, 2023
Before the event :: October 17,2023

if you look closely to the footprint image top left has my region of interest specifically
