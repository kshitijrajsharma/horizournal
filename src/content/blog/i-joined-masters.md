I am excited to share that I have started my Master's program in GeoData Science and GeoAI (AI4EO) as part of the Copernicus Masters in Digital Earth. This is a big step for me, and I want to tell you all about it.

## Why I Chose This Program

I chose this program because I want to become a proper AI engineer. I have a background in Geomatics Engineering with a strong foundation in GIS and Remote Sensing. I have been a spatial developer for the past 8 years, and while I have been working on AI projects, I often found it hard to explain the underlying principles. I became interested in understanding the mathematics behind AI and wanted to gain a deeper knowledge of it. By the time I complete this course, I aim to be a well-rounded AI engineer with a solid foundation in AI and enhanced geo skills.

I also received funding from Copernicus, and their commitment to open source attracted me the most because I value open source to the core.

## About the Program

The GeoData Science and GeoAI (AI4EO) track is part of the Copernicus Masters in Digital Earth program, which is based in Europe. This program is designed to provide advanced education and training in the field of geospatial data science and artificial intelligence for Earth observation. Here are some key details about the program:

- **Location**: Europe (Austria and France)
- **Duration**: 2 years
- **Focus Areas**: Geospatial data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and Earth observation
- **Learning from Experts**: The program offers the opportunity to learn from industry-leading experts and researchers in the field.
- **Hands-On Experience**: Students will work on real-world projects and gain practical experience in applying AI to geospatial data.

## My Goals

During my time in the program, I want to:

- **Learn New Skills**: Improve my abilities in geospatial analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
- **Do Research**: Work on research projects that solve important problems in areas like environmental monitoring and disaster management.
- **Network**: Meet and connect with other students, teachers, and professionals in the field.
- **Make a Difference**: Use my knowledge to create solutions that help make the world more sustainable and fair.

## Looking Ahead

I am looking forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead. GeoData Science and GeoAI are exciting fields, and I am happy to be part of them. I will keep you updated on my journey and hope to inspire others to explore these fields too.

Thank you for your support!
