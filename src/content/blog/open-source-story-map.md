During one of my assignment , I wanted to create story map that is open , free to use and available to everybody . ESRI story maps are popular however ESRI being commercial provider and you need license or vendor locked to use their products . So hunt for open source alternatives begins. 

**Existing Alternatives** 

1) [Story Map JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)

Explaination ..... Features , Advantages , Disadvantages [TBD]

2) [Maplibre- StoryMap](https://github.com/digidem/maplibre-storymap)

I have developed my own version of story map in this website : https://kshitijrajsharma.github.io/ds-storymap/
