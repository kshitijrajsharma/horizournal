During one of my assignment , I wanted to create story map that is open , free to use and available to everybody . ESRI story maps are popular however ESRI being commercial provider and you need license or vendor locked to use their products . So hunt for open source alternatives begins. 

**Existing Alternatives** 

1) [Story Map JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)

Explaination ..... Features , Advantages , Disadvantages [TBD]

StoryMapJS is a free tool to help you tell stories on the web that highlight the locations of a series of events.
Example : 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aefa920-e1fe-4adf-a2ce-6eb93d0da41d)
It has good solid and easy to use method to develop division based on icon on maps , But it doesn't support more division like map animation , Scrolling page ! 

2) [Maplibre- StoryMap](https://github.com/digidem/maplibre-storymap) 


Explaination ..... Features , Advantages , Disadvantages [TBD]

I have developed my own version of story map in this website : https://kshitijrajsharma.github.io/ds-storymap/
