I'm **Kshitij Raj Sharma**, a **passionate spatial developer, AI engineer, and open-source enthusiast** from Nepal. My journey into the world of **open-source development** began in **2016**, when I created a **Nepali OSMTracker Android application** for local surveying. Since then, I've immersed myself in designing **geospatial applications**, leading **AI-for-mapping** initiatives, and fostering **community-driven** open-source projects.

## What Drives Me?

![Drivers](/posts/drive-intersection.png)

I'm drawn to the intersection of these three key topics: 
*Open Source*, *Spatial Data*, *Research Development, and Analysis*. 
Analyzing problems efficiently with *research*, figuring out new *ideas*, and *implementing* them is where I see myself fit. In addition to this, I enjoy exploring drones, field surveying, and mapping. I am a tech enthusiast who is fond of gadgets. Ultimately, my goal is to **make a meaningful impact through my work, with a focus on helping those in need and giving back to the community.**

> “Be kind and work hard; it will get you to the situations you want to be in.”

## Community & Interests

I’m a proud initiator of **[OSGeo Nepal](https://osgeonepal.github.io/)**, helping unite local developers and mappers around open-source geospatial tech. Beyond coding and mapping, I’m an avid explorer of **drone technology**, a **poetry** enthusiast, and I love **basketball**, **FIFA**, **hiking**, and traveling. At home, I spend time with my **cats and dogs**, always recharging for my next open-source endeavor.
