I'm Kshitij Raj Sharma, a **passionate spatial developer** with a strong background in open-source software and open data. Born and raised in rural western Nepal, I pursued my passion for geomatics, graduating from the Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University Nepal.

My contributions to OpenStreetMap and Geospatial Deelopment date back to 2015, My first contribution was creation of Nepali  OSMTracker android application to perform local surveying.

## What Drives Me

I'm drawn to the intersection of these three key topics: *Open Source*, *Spatial Data*, *Research Development, and Analysis*. Analyzing problems efficiently with research, figuring out new ideas, and implementing them is where I see myself fit. In addition to this, I enjoy exploring drones, field surveying, and mapping. I am a tech enthusiast who is fond of gadgets. I find myself reading novels and writing poetry from time to time and love to play basketball. Ultimately, my goal is to **make a meaningful impact through my work, with a focus on helping those in need and giving back to the community.**


> Be kind and work hard; It will get you to the situations you want to be in.


## Works and Contributions

I am an active member and contributor to the following communities: OSGEO , Dev Community , Outreachy , State of the Map , Youth Mappers , OSGEO Nepal , FOSS4G Asia , FOSS4G Global, OSM Nepal

I have more than *14 open-source Python libraries* available on PyPI and some of research on my GitHub, all of them open. I have given talks at multiple conferences, especially FOSS4G and SOTM.

Some of the projects I am proud of include:

- Complete mapping of my own rural municipality (agriculture, education, financial services) 
- Agricultre Land Consolidation Project
- Precision agriculture (Mobile Application)
- Raw-Data-Api
- Free and open-source AI initiative for humanitarian purposes
- OSM-export-tool, making OpenStreetMap and Overturemap data available efficiently to Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)
- Establishing the local geospatial community of developers (OSGEO Nepal), which was my dream and is now a reality

## Personal Interests

When not working, I enjoy playing basketball and FIFA, traveling, and exploring new places. However, my ultimate passion remains mapping, and I continue to advocate for FOSS and contribute to open data initiatives.


Thank you for visiting my blog. I hope to learn , grow and work with others to explore the exciting possibilities of GeoData Science and GeoAI.
