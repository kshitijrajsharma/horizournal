I'm Kshitij Raj Sharma, a **passionate spatial developer** and I talk open source. Born and raised in western rural Nepal, I pursued my passion for geomatics, graduating from the Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University Nepal.

My contributions to OpenStreetMap and Geospatial Deelopment date back to **2016**, My first contribution was creation of Nepali  OSMTracker android application to perform local surveying.

## What Drives Me ?

![Drivers](/posts/drive-intersection.png)

I'm drawn to the intersection of these three key topics: *Open Source*, *Spatial Data*, *Research Development, and Analysis*. Analyzing problems efficiently with research, figuring out new ideas, and implementing them is where I see myself fit. In addition to this, I enjoy exploring drones, field surveying, and mapping. I am a tech enthusiast who is fond of gadgets. Ultimately, my goal is to **make a meaningful impact through my work, with a focus on helping those in need and giving back to the community.**



> Be kind and work hard; It will get you to the situations you want to be in.



I am an active member and contributor to the following communities: **OSGEO , Dev Community , Outreachy , State of the Map , Youth Mappers , OSGEO Nepal , FOSS4G Asia , FOSS4G Global, OSM Nepal**

I have more than *14 open-source Python libraries* available on PyPI and some of research on my GitHub, all of them open. I have given talks at multiple conferences, especially FOSS4G and SOTM.

Some of the projects I am proud of include:

- Complete mapping of my own rural municipality (agriculture, education, financial services) 
- Agricultre Land Consolidation Project
- Precision agriculture (Mobile Application)
- Raw-Data-Api
- Free and open-source AI initiative for humanitarian purposes
- OSM-export-tool, making OpenStreetMap and Overturemap data available efficiently to Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)
- Establishing the local geospatial community of developers (OSGEO Nepal), which was my dream and is now a reality

## Personal Interests

I love my pets. I love writing and reading poems. When not working, I play basketball , Fifa, Go on Hikes , Travel and Explore new places. However, my ultimate passion remains mapping, and I continue to advocate for FOSS and contribute to open data initiatives.
